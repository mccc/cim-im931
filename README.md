# IM931:Interdisciplinary Approaches to Machine Learning

Spring 2019, Centre for Interdisciplinary Methodologies, University of Warwick

## Outline

This module serves as an interdisciplinary introduction to contemporary machine learning research and applications, specifically focusing on the techniques of deep learning which use convolutional and/or recurrent neural network structures to both recognize and generate content from image, text, signals, sound, speech, and other forms of predominantly unstructured data. Using a combination of theoretical/conceptual/historical analysis and practical programming projects in the R programming language, the module will teach the basic application of these techniques while also conveying the historical origins and ethical implications of such applications.
